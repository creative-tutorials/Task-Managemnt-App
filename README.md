# Task-Managemnt-App

In this app I've used Firebase and JavaScript
to be able to use firebase you will have to initialize firebase

you can start intializing your firebase app by installing it using <i>`npm`</i>
<br>

```bash
$ npm install firebase
```


Step 2: intializing full concept


```javascript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
```

```js
// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  //...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```
